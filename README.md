# showcase

#### About
This is simple CMS written in Goland and Angular2 tailored for showcasing personal portfolios. The premise is to build a fast, managable and SEO-friendly self-hosted alternative to services like Behance. No indepth technical knowledge should be required from the users to be able to successfully interact with the project.

#### State
The project is in active development, right now it can be used to host simple portfolio websites. The list of milestones achieved as of now:
- [x] Single binary distribution (No dependencies)
- [x] Portable file database (No external service required)
- [x] Fast server response time
- [x] Basic support for theming
- [x] HTTP/2 Push for certain resources
- [x] SEO optimisations (Automatic generation of meta tags, microdata, sitemap.xml)

#### Further development
In the future I plan to focus on the following:
- [ ] Buidling tests
- [ ] Adding advanced support for theming
- [ ] Replacing Go's default templating markup with a more widespread one like Mustache
- [ ] Adding ability to import projects from external sources (Github, Behance)

#### Installation & usage
I will soon post the instructions regarding project installation and usage, as well as a repository with binaries built for popular platforms.
